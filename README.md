# Text2Images
Converts lines of text to individual images, with various options such as font, color, padding.

This fork is different than original how? Two main changes so far.

1. Default to output PNG instead of JPG. Reason: the jpgs had artifacts showing.

2. For blank lines of text produce a transparent PNG. The original produced no image at all on blank lines of text.
